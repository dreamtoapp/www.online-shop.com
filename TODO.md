- [ ] Split large components into focused subcomponents
  - [x] Some components are split (OrderCard, OrderCardView, DashboardHeader)
  - [ ] Large components remain in some order/product views
  - [ ] Audit and refactor large components for maintainability
  - [ ] Document component splitting strategy

### Database & Query Optimization
- [ ] Add indexes to frequently queried fields
  - [ ] No evidence of custom indexes found in schema
  - [ ] Audit query logs and slow queries for index candidates
  - [ ] Add indexes via Prisma migration
  - [ ] Document index strategy and rationale
- [ ] Use aggregation queries for analytics
  - [x] Some aggregation queries used for analytics (order counts, sales, etc.)
  - [ ] Audit all analytics for aggregation opportunities
  - [ ] Refactor analytics to use efficient aggregation
  - [ ] Document aggregation query strategy
- [ ] Structured logging for slow queries
  - [ ] No structured logging for slow queries found
  - [ ] Audit for slow queries in production
  - [ ] Implement structured logging (e.g., Prisma, pino, Winston)
  - [ ] Document slow query logging approach

### Static Asset & Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Lazy load images & icons
  - [x] Lazy loading used for product images and some icons
  - [ ] Audit all images/icons for consistent lazy loading
  - [ ] Refactor to use Next.js <Image> and dynamic imports where possible
  - [ ] Document lazy loading strategy
- [ ] Optimize bundles (tree-shaking, Webpack/Vite)
  - [x] Some bundle optimizations in next.config.js (splitChunks, deviceSizes, formats)
  - [ ] Audit bundle size and unused dependencies
  - [ ] Refactor imports and enable tree-shaking for all packages
  - [ ] Document bundle optimization strategy

### Localization & Internationalization
- [ ] Integrate next-intl/i18next for translations
  - [ ] No evidence of next-intl or i18next integration found
  - [ ] Audit for hardcoded strings and translation needs
  - [ ] Integrate next-intl or i18next for multi-language support
  - [ ] Document translation and localization strategy
- [ ] Memoize translation objects
  - [ ] No memoization of translation objects found
  - [ ] Audit translation usage for performance
  - [ ] Implement memoization for translation objects
