# Debounce & Throttle Integration Plan

## 1. **Where to Use Debounce**
- **Search bars**: Debounce user input before firing API calls.
- **Auto-save fields**: Debounce save actions to avoid excessive requests.
- **Resize/scroll events**: Debounce expensive UI updates.

**Example:**
```js
import debounce from 'debounce';

const handleSearch = debounce((value) => {
  // Call API with value
}, 300);

<input onChange={e => handleSearch(e.target.value)} />
```

---

## 2. **Where to Use Throttle**
- **Button clicks** (e.g., Add to Cart): Prevent rapid double-clicks.
- **Scroll-based animations**: Limit frequency of updates.

**Example:**
```js
function throttle(fn, wait) {
  let last = 0;
  return (...args) => {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - last > wait) {
      last = now;
      fn(...args);
    }
  };
}

const handleAddToCart = throttle(() => {
  // Add to cart logic
}, 1000);

<button onClick={handleAddToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
```

## 3. **Integration Steps**
1. **Audit the codebase** for all user input, button click, and event handler locations.
2. **Apply debounce** to search, input, and auto-save handlers.
3. **Apply throttle** to critical button actions (e.g., Add to Cart, Place Order).
4. **Test** for UX smoothness and ensure no action is lost or excessively delayed.
5. **Document** usage in code comments for future maintainers.

---

## 4. **Best Practices**
- Use debounce for input fields, throttle for button clicks.
- Keep debounce/throttle delays user-friendly (100â€“500ms typical).
- Always clean up debounced/throttled functions in React effects to avoid memory leaks.
- Avoid debouncing/throttling critical security actions (e.g., login, payment confirm).

## 5. **Next Steps**
- [ ] Identify all relevant handlers in the app.
- [ ] Refactor with debounce/throttle as per above.
- [ ] Review and test for performance and UX.
- [ ] Update documentation.
