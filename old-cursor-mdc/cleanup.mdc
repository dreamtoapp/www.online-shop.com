# ðŸ§¹ CLEANUP RULES

## 1. ALWAYS REMOVE UNUSED VARIABLES
- After writing code, check for any variables, imports, or functions that are not used.
- Delete them to keep the code clean and easy to read.
- This helps prevent bugs and makes the project faster.

## 2. ALWAYS FIX LINTER ISSUES AFTER TASKS
- When you finish a task, always run the linter (for example: `pnpm lint` or `npm run lint`).
- Fix all warnings and errors before you consider the task done.
- Clean code is easier for everyone to work with.

**These cleanup steps are required every time you finish a coding task!**
