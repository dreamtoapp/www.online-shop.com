# üìù TASK COLLABORATION RULE

- For every task, a Markdown file is created in `docs/task/` as a checklist and reference.
- The user can review the file and add their own notes, edits, or feedback directly in the Markdown file.
- When the user says **'update'**, the AI will:
  - Read the latest version of the Markdown file
  - Apply the user's notes and feedback
  - Refactor or update the file as needed
- This workflow should be used for all tasks to make collaboration easy and keep everything organized.

**This ensures you always have control, and the AI keeps your plans and progress up to date!**
