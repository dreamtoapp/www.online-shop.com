# üìÅ FOLDER STRUCTURE RULE

- When you give a relative path for a new feature or route, always use this structure:
  - `components/` for UI components
  - `actions/` for server actions or business logic
  - `helpers/` for utility functions and hooks
- If any of these folders do not exist, create them and add a `README.md` explaining what goes inside.
- If the folder exists, make sure each file is in the correct subfolder:
  - UI components go in `components/`
  - Server actions go in `actions/`
  - Utility functions/hooks go in `helpers/`
- This keeps the project organized and easy to understand for everyone!
