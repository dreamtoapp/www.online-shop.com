# ðŸ“‹ CONTEXT COPY RULE

- Whenever you type **copy context**, the AI MUST create a Markdown file (in the `docs/task/` folder) for each current task.
- The file should include:
  - What the task is
  - What has been done so far
  - What is left to do
  - Any important notes or decisions
- This way, if you restart your laptop or Cursor, you can always pick up where you left off.
- The file name should be clear, like `docs/task/task-[short-description].md`.
- This keeps you always on track and never starting from the beginning again!
