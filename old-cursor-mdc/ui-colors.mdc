# ðŸŽ¨ UI & COLOR CONSISTENCY RULES

## 1. ALWAYS USE THE DESIGN SYSTEM COLORS
- Use only the colors defined in `tailwind.config.ts` (like `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `destructive`, etc.).
- Never use hardcoded hex colors or random Tailwind colors in components.
- For backgrounds, borders, and text, use the semantic color names (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`).
- For status (success, warning, error), use the provided semantic colors (e.g., `success-fg`, `danger-fg`).

## 2. FOLLOW UI COMPONENT PATTERNS
- Always use the shared UI components from `components/ui/` (Button, Card, Alert, Badge, etc.)
- Do not create custom styles for buttons, cards, alerts, or badgesâ€”use the provided variants and props.
- For new UI elements, follow the same structure and naming as existing components.

## 3. BACKGROUND & PATTERN CONSISTENCY
- Use the `Background` component for page/section backgrounds and patterns.
- Use the provided background and pattern presets (e.g., `usersBlue`, `productsGreen`, `classicGrid`, `blobs`).
- Do not use custom backgrounds or patterns unless added to the design system.

## 4. RESPONSIVE & ACCESSIBLE
- Always use responsive classes and test on all screen sizes.
- Use semantic HTML and ensure color contrast is accessible.

**These rules keep the UI looking professional and consistent everywhere!**
