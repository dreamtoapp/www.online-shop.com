# ðŸª“ COMPONENT SIZE RULE

- If any component file is more than **70 lines**, you MUST break it into smaller components.
- Each smaller component should:
  - Have a clear, single responsibility
  - Be placed in the correct folder (`components/`, `actions/`, or `helpers/`) according to its purpose
- This keeps code easy to read, test, and maintain.
- If you split a component, update or create a `README.md` in the folder to explain the structure.

**Big components make code hard to understand. Small components are better for everyone!**
