# Docs (Notes)

- Before starting something big, check the docs in the `docs/` folder.
- Update the docs as you work, so everyone knows what's happening.
- Write down why you made changes in `why-we-did-this.md`.
- If you fix a problem, update `problems.md`.
- If you make things faster, update `how-fast.md`.
- If you add tests, update `test-status.md`.
- This helps everyone and makes the project better for the future.
