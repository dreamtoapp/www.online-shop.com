# âš¡ PERFORMANCE RULES

1. Always use next/image for all images, with width, height, and alt.
2. Use dynamic imports and lazy loading for large or rarely-used components.
3. Prefer Server Components and Server Actions; minimize client-side JS.
4. Fetch data server-side and avoid duplicate API calls.
5. Serve assets from a CDN and set proper cache headers.
6. Only import needed CSS/fonts; purge unused styles.
7. Track and fix Core Web Vitals issues.
8. Avoid blocking the main thread with heavy JS.
9. Test performance regularly and set budgets.
10. Keep dependencies lean and audit bundle size.
