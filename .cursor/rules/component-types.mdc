# Component Types (Server vs Client)

- Use **Server components** by default. They are faster and better for SEO.
- Use **Client components** only if you need:
  - Buttons or click events
  - Forms or user input
  - Browser features (like localStorage, geolocation)
  - React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- If you see `'use client'` at the top, it is a Client component.
- If you are not sure, ask or check with the team.
