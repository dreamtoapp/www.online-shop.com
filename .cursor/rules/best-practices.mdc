# ðŸŒŸ BEST PRACTICE RULES

## 1. WRITE SHORT, CLEAR COMMENTS
- Comments must always be short and clear.
- Never use JSDoc or long comment blocks.
- Only use simple, direct comments (e.g., // fetch user data, // handle error).
- Add comments to explain why, not just what, but keep them brief.

## 2. USE MEANINGFUL NAMES
- Name variables, functions, and files clearly and descriptively.
- Avoid short or unclear names like `x`, `data1`, `temp`.

## 3. KEEP FUNCTIONS SHORT
- Each function should do one thing and be under 30 lines if possible.
- If a function is getting long, split it up.

## 4. REUSE CODE
- Don't copy-paste codeâ€”make reusable functions or components.
- Use shared helpers and utilities.

## 5. HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY
- Always handle errors and show helpful messages.
- Never let the app crash for the user.

## 6. WRITE TESTS
- Add tests for important logic and new features.
- Update tests when you change code.

## 7. KEEP FILES ORGANIZED
- Use the correct folder for each file (components, actions, helpers, etc.).
- Add or update README.md files to explain folder contents.

## 8. REVIEW CODE
- Always review your code before marking a task as done.
- If working with others, do code reviews and give helpful feedback.

**Following these best practices makes the project better for everyone!**
